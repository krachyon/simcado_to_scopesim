- make photometry_benchmark able to run a subset (command line switch?)
- histogram plot for x-y and mag deviation

- add a way to start with a decent guess of the PSF in the process
    * Get EPSF model from known PSF shape done by scopesim
- Using 'x' and 'x_orig' for the tables is a bit awful as it makes the functions less generic
- Calculate image stats only once and propagate

- Main issue: How to tune starfinders?


- Technical issue: Using spawn/forkserver plays nicely with notebooks and uses less memory,
but causes issues with passing functions, e.g. if you pass
lambda x: testdata_generators.generate()
testdata_generators is not imported in the place that executes the lambda it errors
Is there a way of avoiding that? Or warning the user?
