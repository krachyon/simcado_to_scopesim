- make photometry_benchmark able to run a subset (command line switch?)
- histogram plot for x-y and mag deviation

- add a way to start with a decent guess of the PSF in the process
    * Get EPSF model from known PSF shape done by scopesim
- Using 'x' and 'x_orig' for the tables is a bit awful as it makes the functions less generic
- Calculate image stats only once and propagate

- Main issue: How to tune starfinders?
